    <h1>FoodFinder Proposal</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            - Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest
            (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").<br>
            - Identify an information technology problem in that space
            (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").<br>
            - Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem
            (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")<br>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            - Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? 
            What impacts might this app have on minority groups? <br>

            - What will the users do with the web app? 
            What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? 
            Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; 
            be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are! Remember:<br>
                - Remember that "viewing" information or navigating ("going to") to something isn't a feature! <br>

            - What kind of information will the users be viewing? 
            If intend to use data from an external source (a csv file or an API), 
            include a link and citation to that data. <br>
                - If you insist on using an API, confirm that you'll be able to access it from a client-side 
                app by testing it at https://joelwross.github.io/cors-test/Links to an external site.
                If you can't get data back from this testing site, then it won't work with your project. <br>
            <!-- include reference to other resource here -->

            - How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? 
            That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?<br>
                - Remember the app doesn't need to have "business value". 
                But as Informatics students we care about the practical usage and impacts of systems, 
                not just their implementation. Be sure to consider that in your proposal!<br>
