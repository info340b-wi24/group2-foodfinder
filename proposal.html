        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            In our daily lives, we've identified an issue concerning the lack of a dedicated platform for students in the Seattle area to share food recommendations and rate local restaurants. While existing food review apps like <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> and Google Reviews attempt to address this need, they fall short in catering specifically to the student community and highlighting small, locally-owned businesses. These generic platforms lack features to filter reviewers to only students, making it challenging for young adults to find reviews written by like minded individuals. They don't offer specialized features to exclusively spotlight small, local establishments, leaving a gap in the market for a more community-driven solution.
        </p>

        <p>
            To tackle this problem, we are proposing the development of a student-centric web app that verifies users' student status and prioritizes reviews and ratings from fellow students. This platform would not only enhance the reliability of reviews by ensuring they come from within the student community but also focus on promoting small, local businesses. The aim is to create a sense of community engagement and encourage students to actively participate in sharing their culinary experiences while supporting the growth of local food establishments. By addressing this specific problem, the web app seeks to enrich the student experience at the University of Washington, in Seattle in general, and contribute to the sustainability of small businesses in the region.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            Our web app is designed for college students at the University of Washington and the broader Seattle area, aiming to create a community-driven platform for sharing food recommendations and supporting local businesses. The app's primary users are students, so that they can get recommendations from like minded voices. By focusing on local restaurants and utilizing .edu email verification, we ensure that the reviews and interactions are centered around the student community.
        </p>

        <p>Users of the web app will have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to upload food reviews.
                <ul>
                    <li>enabling them to share their experiences and preferences with fellow students.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>The search feature.
                <ul>
                    <li>allows users to look up specific restaurants they are interested in and see their peers thoughts on them.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Filtering functionality.
                <ul>
                    <li>enables efficient exploration of local businesses based on specific criteria they are looking for, contributing to a user-friendly experience.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>  

        <p>
            The information users will be viewing is primarily user-generated content in the form of reviews, recommendations, and restaurant details. To kickstart the platform, we will initially populate it with information about several local businesses using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oklena/seattle-area-restaurants">datasets available online</a> While the app relies on user-generated content, these pre-existing entries ensure that users have content to engage with from the outset.The app addresses the identified problem by focusing exclusively on local restaurants, excluding fast-food and restaurant chains, and implementing .edu email verification to create a student-centric community. By doing so, it narrows the scope to provide a platform where students can trust and rely on reviews from their peers, fostering a sense of community engagement and encouraging support for small, local businesses. The practical usage and impact of the system lie in enriching the student experience, promoting local businesses, and creating a space where diverse voices contribute to shaping the culinary narrative of Seattle.
